📌 Overview

Campus Ride is a smart, eco-friendly, OTP-verified E-Rickshaw pooling system built for university campuses.
It enables students, drivers, and administrators to seamlessly coordinate transportation through:

Real-time ride requests

Intelligent ride pooling

Live driver tracking

OTP-based boarding verification

Role-based authentication

Smooth UI/UX for different user types

This project was developed as a Software Engineering (SE) course project, following proper SDLC guidelines, documentation (SRS, DFD, UML), testing, and deployment.

🎯 Problem Statement

Large campuses like Thapar University face challenges:

Long walking distances between blocks

No organized real-time pooling system

Difficulty locating available E-rickshaws

Safety concerns without OTP verification

Lack of a unified platform for students & drivers

Campus Ride solves this by offering a centrally managed, ride-pooling system to reduce waiting time, congestion, and environmental impact.

🔐 Role-Based Authentication

Each signup stores:

users/{uid}:
  name
  email
  role: "student" | "driver" | "admin"
  createdAt


Protected routes:

/student → Students only

/driver → Drivers only

/admin → Admin only

If a student manually types /driver → redirected safely.

🧠 Intelligent Pooling Flow

Student requests ride

System searches active drivers

Pool formed with matching routes

Driver receives request

OTP verification at pickup

Live ride tracking

Trip completion + history logging

🧭 How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ishaan0709/Campus-Ride-Smart-E-Rickshaw-Pooling-System.git
cd Campus-Ride-Smart-E-Rickshaw-Pooling-System

2. Install packages
npm install

3. Setup Firebase environment

Create .env:

VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=xxxx
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=xxxx
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=xxxx
...

4. Run
npm run dev


App will run at:

http://localhost:5173

## Nearby search: every auto, or hex cells

Uber draws hexagonal cells because it has to search millions of drivers. This campus has a few dozen e-rickshaws, so the dispatch engine checks every auto and then measures the trip on the campus road graph with Dijkstra. The hex grid is still available, behind the same `SpatialIndex` port, and the Simulation Lab can draw those cells as a demand heatmap.

A measured run of 100 searches (`npm test`, this machine):

| Fleet | Check every auto | Hex cells |
|---|---|---|
| 50 autos on a campus | 0.52 ms, opened 50, kept about 28 | 7.36 ms, opened 49, kept about 28 |
| 5,000 autos across a city | 22.07 ms, opened 5,000, kept about 79 | 5.47 ms, opened 193, kept about 79 |

Both methods kept the same nearby autos. Hex cells are worth it when the fleet is spread across a city. On one campus the extra cell math is slower, and the cells are used to show where students are asking.

📌 Future Improvements
